				<div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>This is an application that has two different uses:</p> 
<p>Instant Feed - Use tweets that contain the words you introduce to process a counting of all words and gives you the statistics</p>
<p>Research Feed - Use tweets that contain the words you introduce but this time after your classification of some tweets the application will be able to do her own classification, giving you the counting of words separated by sentiment( good , bad )</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How can I use this?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>To start is better to use Instant Feed that way you will be able to know if the words you want to use for tweets search are being used in twitter.</p>
<p>Also, you are able to know what are the most used words in the tweets with that help you can use better words to get tweets for the research</p>

<p>After you know the words you want to use in research you start doing a Research Feed you will have to introduce the words and how many tweets you want to get to evaluate.
<p>Done the evaluation the application will ask you words again and how many tweets you want the application to classify</p> 
<p>Done that you can access to the words counting and how many tweets the application determine as good or bad.</p>
